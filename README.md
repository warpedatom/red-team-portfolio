## About This Repository

This repository serves as a **portfolio of red team and adversary simulation research**, focused on practical implementations of attacker tradecraft, detection validation, and system hardening within controlled lab environments.

It includes:

- Hands-on Active Directory attack and defense scenarios  
- Adversary emulation aligned with the MITRE ATT&CK framework  
- Automated red team tooling and environment setup scripts  
- Technical write-ups, methodology blogs, and one-page lab summaries  

Each project emphasizes both the **offensive methodology** and the corresponding **defensive insights** — designed to showcase practical expertise, analytical rigor, and continuous skill development in cybersecurity operations.

## Highlights

Key capabilities and focus areas demonstrated through the included lab environments and project documentation:

- **Active Directory Pentest Lab** — Kerberoasting, AS-REP Roasting, BloodHound mapping, and Ticket/Certificate attacks  
- **Adversary Simulation** — ATT&CK-aligned scenarios with threat emulation and detection testing  
- **GPU-Accelerated Password Auditing** — Optimized cracking operations (Hashcat / RTX 3080)  
- **Toolkit Automation & SOPs** — Streamlined repeatable lab runs and red team workflows  
- **Defensive Correlation** — Analysis of logs, detections, and event traces for Blue Team validation
