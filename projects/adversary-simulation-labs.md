# Adversary Simulation Labs

**Objective**  
Design and execute adversary simulations based on known APT behaviors to validate detection and improve red-team realism.

**Scenario Design**  
- Mapped APT techniques to MITRE ATT&CK (initial access, privilege escalation, persistence, C2)  
- Implemented payload execution via spear-phishing, scheduled tasks, and C2 frameworks (e.g., Cobalt Strike-like behaviors)

**Execution**  
- Conducted credential harvesting (Mimikatz, Rubeus)  
- Tested detection response and log correlation in simulated blue-team setups  

**Outcome**  
Generated after-action reports identifying gaps in detection logic, helping refine simulation methodology and improve SOC alert fidelity.
