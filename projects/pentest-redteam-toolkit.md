# Pentest & Red-Team Toolkit Automation

**Objective**  
Standardize red-team lab deployment and streamline setup of core offensive tools.

**Approach**  
- Designed provisioning scripts (Bash, PowerShell, Ansible) to automate installation and configuration of reconnaissance → exploitation → post-exploitation → reporting stages  
- Created SOPs for consistent lab setup across multiple VMs  

**Outcome**  
Reduced environment setup time by ~50%, increased reproducibility of red-team simulations, and improved readiness for penetration-testing certifications.
