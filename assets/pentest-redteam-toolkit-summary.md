# Pentest & Red-Team Toolkit Automation — Summary

**Author:** Velkris (Jared Perry)  
**Focus:** Offensive Security Engineering / Environment Automation  
**Environment:** Custom Kali Linux toolkit with Bash, PowerShell, and Ansible provisioning  
**Purpose:** Streamline setup, configuration, and operation of a standardized red-team toolkit for repeatable lab and assessment workflows.

---

## Objective
Design and implement a modular automation framework to deploy a consistent, mission-ready red-team toolkit across multiple lab environments—reducing manual setup time and configuration drift.

---

## Toolkit Architecture
| Component | Function |
|------------|-----------|
| **Base OS** | Kali Linux (rolling) with custom hardening and persistent storage |
| **Automation Layer** | Bash and PowerShell scripts orchestrated through Ansible |
| **Tool Categories** | Reconnaissance, exploitation, post-exploitation, reporting |
| **Version Control** | Git-based synchronization and tool version pinning |

---

## Methodology
- Automated provisioning of reconnaissance, exploitation, and reporting tools via scripted installers.  
- Integrated common frameworks (Impacket, CrackMapExec, Evil-WinRM, Burp Suite, BloodHound).  
- Implemented configuration checks and log validation for consistency.  
- Documented SOPs to support repeatable deployments across virtualized environments.

## Tools & Frameworks
Ansible • Bash • PowerShell • Git • Python • Kali Linux • BloodHound • CrackMapExec • Burp Suite • Evil-WinRM

---

## Results
| Metric | Outcome |
|---------|----------|
| **Deployment Time** | Reduced by ~50% through scripted provisioning. |
| **Consistency** | Identical toolset and configuration across all test VMs. |
| **Reusability** | Version-controlled scripts enable easy rebuilds for future labs. |

---

## Recommendations
- Maintain version-locked manifests for tool dependencies.  
- Expand automation to include reporting templates and evidence archiving.  
- Integrate with CI/CD pipelines for long-term red-team infrastructure readiness.

---

## Outcome
Delivered a **standardized, automated toolkit** improving readiness for red-team engagements and certification labs.  
Enabled consistent recon-to-report workflows and simplified maintenance of multiple offensive environments.

> This project highlights technical efficiency, reproducibility, and disciplined engineering within offensive-security operations.
