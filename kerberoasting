# Kerberoasting: overview, detection signals, and mitigations

**Tags:** kerberoast, kerberos, active-directory, mitre-attck

**Summary**  
Kerberoasting targets service accounts in Active Directory by requesting service tickets for SPNs and attempting offline cracking of the ticket material. This post explains the attack mechanics at a conceptual level, highlights realistic detection signals, and lists practical mitigations defenders can apply.

**Context / Objective**  
Objective: understand the lifecycle of Kerberoast activity in a lab environment and identify monitoring and hardening steps that reduce enterprise risk.

**Environment (lab)**  
Isolated test lab: 1 Domain Controller, 2 workstations. All testing performed on VMs owned and controlled by the author.

**Conceptual mechanics**  
- Kerberos issues service tickets (TGS) for service principal names (SPNs). Service accounts associated with SPNs can be targeted because their service tickets contain material that is crackable offline if the account password is weak.  
- Kerberoasting exploits credential quality (service-account password strength), not a protocol flaw in Kerberos itself. Requesting a service ticket for an SPN is a normal Kerberos action; the risk comes from offline cracking.

**Observations (lab)**  
- Increased volume of TGS requests against service accounts is a primary observable event.  
- Offline cracking time depends heavily on password complexity and hash type.  
- Managed or gMSA accounts and strong passwords materially reduce practical risk.

**Detection signals**  
- Unusual volume of TGS requests originating from a single host or account.  
- TGS requests for uncommon SPNs or from unexpected hosts.  
- Correlation with other anomalous activity (suspicious authentication patterns, new service installation, or abnormal schedule).

**Mitigations & hardening**  
- Enforce strong, unique passwords for service accounts; prefer managed service accounts where possible.  
- Audit and reduce unnecessary SPNs to limit the attack surface.  
- Monitor and alert on anomalous TGS request volumes and origin hosts.  
- Implement account-hygiene controls (rotate service-account credentials, restrict delegation).  
- Reduce ticket lifetimes where practical and validate time-based or behavioral anomalies in authentication telemetry.

**Outcome / Lessons learned**  
Kerberoasting in a lab emphasized that robust account hygiene and targeted monitoring are the most effective mitigations. Defender value comes from mapping observable authentication telemetry to attack lifecycles and prioritizing alerts that indicate ticket abuse patterns.
